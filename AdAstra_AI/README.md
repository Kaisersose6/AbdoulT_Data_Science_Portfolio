ðŸš€ Project Overview
OmniEngage is an AI-driven marketing optimization system that dynamically adjusts customer engagement strategies in real-time using reinforcement learning, multi-touch attribution, and NLP personalization. It solves:

Wasted ad spend (~30% industry average) due to static customer journeys.

Inefficient attribution (last-click bias) leading to poor channel allocation.

Generic messaging reducing engagement rates.

Core Innovations:
âœ… Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven path optimization
âœ… Explainable attribution with SHAP & Bayesian networks
âœ… Hyper-personalized content generation via fine-tuned LLMs
âœ… Automated A/B testing with contextual bandits
