# About Me

I'm a Senior Data Scientist with over a decade of experience turning messy data into meaningful insights. My work spans marketing analytics, customer segmentation, predictive modeling, and business 

intelligence—always driven by a curiosity to understand what moves the needle.


I specialize in Python, SQL, and PySpark, and I’m fluent in cloud platforms and visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI. Whether I’m optimizing a marketing campaign or building a data pipeline from 

scratch, I aim to deliver solutions that are not just technically sound, but strategically valuable.


Outside of work, I’ve taught statistics and math at the college level and trained teams in data fluency, helping organizations become more data-driven from the ground up. I also hold a master’s in statistics, 

and when I’m not wrangling data, you’ll probably find me on the mats—I've been passionate about Brazilian jiu-jitsu for 12 years.


Thanks for stopping by my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects, and let’s connect if you’re working on something exciting.
