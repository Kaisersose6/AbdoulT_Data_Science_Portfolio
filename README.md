# Welcome to my data science portfolio!

My name is Abdoul Toure and I am a data scientist with 7 years of experience in the analytics field. 

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of data science projects, ranging from [Project 1] to [Project 2].

In this portfolio, you will find a selection of my most notable projects and accomplishments. Each project includes a description of the problem I was trying to solve, the methods and techniques I used, and the results I achieved. 

I have also included code and data visualizations to provide a deeper understanding of my work.

I hope that this portfolio will give you a sense of my skills and experience in data science and the value that I can bring to your organization. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio.
